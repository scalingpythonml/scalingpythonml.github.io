properties:
  imagePullSecret:
    type: object
    description: |
      This is configuration to create a k8s Secret resource of `type:
      kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`, with credentials to pull images from a
      private image registry. If you opt to do so, it will be available for use
      by all pods in their respective `spec.imagePullSecrets` alongside other
      k8s Secrets defined in `imagePullSecrets` or the pod respective
      `...image.pullSecrets` configuration.

      In other words, using this configuration option can automate both the
      otherwise manual creation of a k8s Secret and the otherwise manual
      configuration to reference this k8s Secret in all the pods of the Helm
      chart.

      ```sh
      # you won't need to create a k8s Secret manually...
      kubectl create secret docker-registry image-pull-secret \
        --docker-server=<REGISTRY> \
        --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
        --docker-email=<EMAIL> \
        --docker-password=<PASSWORD>
      ```

      If you just want to let all Pods reference an existing secret, use the
      `imagePullSecrets` configuration instead.

        description: |
          Name of the private registry you want to create a credential set for.
          It will default to Docker Hub's image registry.

          Examples:
            - https://index.docker.io/v1/
            - quay.io
            - eu.gcr.io

      username:
        type: string
        description: |
          Name of the user you want to use to connect to your private registry.

          For external gcr.io, you will use the `_json_key`.

          Examples:
            - alexmorreale
            - alex@pfc.com
            - _json_key
      password:
        type: string
        description: |
          Password for the private image registry's user.

          Examples:
            - plaintextpassword
            - abc123SECRETzyx098

          For gcr.io registries the password will be a big JSON blob for a
          Google cloud service account, it should look something like below.

          ```yaml
          password: |-
            {
              "type": "service_account",
              "project_id": "jupyter-se",
              "private_key_id": "f2ba09118a8d3123b3321bd9a7d6d0d9dc6fdb85",

      This will not override or get overridden by pod specific configuration,
      but instead augment the pod specific configuration.

      You can use both the k8s native syntax, where each list element is like
      `{"name": "my-secret-name"}`, or you can let list elements be strings
      naming the secrets directly.

          `ENTRYPOINT` entry. Note that in k8s lingo, the Dockerfile's
          `ENTRYPOINT` is called `command`. The list of strings will be expanded
          with Helm's template function `tpl` which can render Helm template
          logic inside curly braces (`{{... }}`).

          This could be useful to wrap the invocation of JupyterHub itself in
          some custom way.

          A list of strings to be used to replace the JupyterHub image's `CMD`
          entry as well as the Helm chart's default way to start JupyterHub.
          Note that in k8s lingo, the Dockerfile's `CMD` is called `args`. The
          list of strings will be expanded with Helm's template function `tpl`
          which can render Helm template logic inside curly braces (`{{... }}`).

          ```{warning}
          By replacing the entire configuration file, which is mounted to
          `/etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py` by the Helm chart, instead of
          appending to it with `hub.extraConfig`, you expose your deployment for
          issues stemming from getting out of sync with the Helm chart's config
          file.

          These kind of issues will be significantly harder to debug and
          diagnose, and can due to this could cause a lot of time expenditure
          for both the community maintaining the Helm chart as well as yourself,
          even if this wasn't the reason for the issue.
          
          Due to this, we ask that you do your _absolute best to avoid replacing
          the default provided `jupyterhub_config.py` file. It can often be
          possible. For example, if your goal is to have a dedicated .py file
          for more extensive additions that you can syntax highlight and such
          and feel limited by passing code in `hub.extraConfig` which is part of
          a YAML file, you can use [this
          trick](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/1580#issuecomment-707776237)
          instead.

          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
          secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
          save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
          the hub container. A value set here will make JupyterHub overwrite any previous file.

          You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
          storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
          default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
          value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
          restarts.

          Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
          *immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised

            description: |
              Type of database backend to use for the hub database.

              The Hub requires a persistent database to function, and this lets you specify
              where it should be stored.

              The various options are:

              1. **sqlite-pvc**

                 Use an `sqlite` database kept on a persistent volume attached to the hub.

                 By default, this disk is created by the cloud provider using
                 *dynamic provisioning* configured by a [storage
                 class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
                 You can customize how this disk is created / attached by
                 setting various properties under `hub.db.pvc`.

                 This is the default setting, and should work well for most cloud provider
                 deployments.

              2. **sqlite-memory**

                 Use an in-memory `sqlite` database. This should only be used for testing,
                 since the database is erased whenever the hub pod restarts - causing the hub
                 to lose all memory of users who had logged in before.

                 When using this for testing, make sure you delete all other objects that the
                 hub has created (such as user pods, user PVCs, etc) every time the hub restarts.
                 Otherwise you might run into errors about duplicate resources.

              3. **mysql**

                 Use an externally hosted mysql database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the mysql database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 mysql+pymysql://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

                 Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.

              4. **postgres**

                 Use an externally hosted postgres database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the postgres database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 postgres+psycopg2://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

                 Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.

            - Configure code running in the hub pod, such as an authenticator or
              spawner.

          String literals with `$(ENV_VAR_NAME)` will be expanded by Kubelet which
          is a part of Kubernetes.

          ```yaml
          hub:
            extraEnv:
              # basic notation (for literal values only)
              MY_ENV_VARS_NAME1: "my env var value 1"

              # explicit notation (the "name" field takes precedence)
              HUB_NAMESPACE:
                name: HUB_NAMESPACE
                valueFrom:
                  fieldRef:
                    fieldPath: metadata.namespace

              # implicit notation (the "name" field is implied)
              PREFIXED_HUB_NAMESPACE:
                value: "my-prefix-$(HUB_NAMESPACE)"
              SECRET_VALUE:
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: my-k8s-secret
                    key: password
          ```

      extraConfig:
        type: object
        description: |
          Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

          This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
          that is not present here as an option, you can write the raw Python to do it here.

          extraConfig is a *dict*, so there can be multiple configuration snippets
          under different names.
          The configuration sections are run in alphabetical order.

          Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
            - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
            - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
            - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
            - Anything else you can think of!

          Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
          [| operator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688).

          For example:
            ```yaml
            hub:
              extraConfig:
                myConfig.py: |
                  c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
                  c.Spawner.somethingelse = 'something else'
            ```

          No validation of this python is performed! If you make a mistake here, it will probably
          manifest as either the hub pod going into `Error` or `CrashLoopBackoff` states, or in
          some special cases, the hub running but... just doing very random things. Be careful!
      uid:
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        description:
          The UID the hub process should be running as.

          Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a user with this uid
          exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!

          Defaults to 1000, which is the uid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the
          default hub image.
      fsGid:
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        description:
          The gid the hub process should be using when touching any volumes mounted.

          Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a group with this gid
          exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!

          Defaults to 1000, which is the gid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the
          default hub image.

              Note that these will be appended last, and if you provide the same

        description: |
          Pod Priority is used to allow real users evict placeholder pods that
          in turn triggers a scale up by a cluster autoscaler. So, enabling this
          option will only make sense if the following conditions are met:

          1. Your Kubernetes cluster has at least version 1.11
          2. A cluster autoscaler is installed
          3. user-placeholer pods is configured to get a priority equal or
             higher than the cluster autoscaler's priority cutoff
          4. Normal user pods have a higher priority than the user-placeholder
             pods

          Note that if the default priority cutoff if not configured on cluster
          autoscaler, it will currently default to 0, and that in the future
          this is meant to be lowered. If your cloud provider is installing the
          cluster autoscaler for you, they may also configure this specifically.

          Recommended settings for a cluster autoscaler...

          ... with a priority cutoff of -10 (GKE):

          ```yaml
          podPriority:
            enabled: true
            globalDefault: false
            defaultPriority: 0
            userPlaceholderPriority: -10
          ```

          ... with a priority cutoff of 0:

          ```yaml
          podPriority:
            enabled: true
            globalDefault: true
            defaultPriority: 10
            userPlaceholderPriority: 0

            type: bool
            description: |
              Warning! This will influence all pods in the cluster.

              The priority a pod usually get is 0. But this can be overridden
              with a PriorityClass resource if it is declared to be the global
              default. This configuration option allows for the creation of such
              global default.

      userPlaceholder:
        type: object
        description: |
          User placeholders simulate users but will thanks to PodPriority be
          evicted by the cluster autoscaler if a real user shows up. In this way
          placeholders allow you to create a headroom for the real users and
          reduce the risk of a user having to wait for a node to be added. Be
          sure to use the the continuous image puller as well along with
          placeholders, so the images are also available when real users arrive.

          To test your setup efficiently, you can adjust the amount of user
          placeholders with the following command:
          ```sh
          # Configure to have 3 user placeholders

      resources:

        description: |
          These are standard Kubernetes resources with requests and limits for
          cpu and memory. They will be used on the containers in the pods
          pulling images. These should be set extremely low as the containers
          shut down directly or is a pause container that just idles.

          They were made configurable as usage of ResourceQuota may require
          containers in the namespace to have explicit resources set.

          podSchedulingWaitDuration:
            description: |
              The `hook-image-awaiter` has a criteria to await all the
              `hook-image-puller` DaemonSet's pods to both schedule and finish
              their image pulling. This flag can be used to relax this criteria
              to instead only await the pods that _has already scheduled_ to
              finish image pulling after a certain duration.

              The value of this is that sometimes the newly created
              `hook-image-puller` pods cannot be scheduled because nodes are
              full, and then it probably won't make sense to block a `helm
              upgrade`.

              An infinite duration to wait for pods to schedule can be
              represented by `-1`. This was the default behavior of version
              0.9.0 and earlier.

      pullProfileListImages:

        description: |
          The singleuser.profileList configuration can let the user choose an
          image through the selection of a profile. This option determines if
          those images will be pulled, both by the hook and continuous pullers.

          The reason to disable this, is that if you have for example 10 images
          which start pulling in order from 1 to 10, a user that arrives and
          wants to start a pod with image number 10 will need to wait for all
          images to be pulled, and then it may be preferable to just let the
          user arriving wait for a single image to be pulled on arrival.

      Additional values to pass to the Hub.
      JupyterHub will not itself look at these,

      For example:

      ```yaml
      custom:
        myHost: "https://example.horse"
      hub:
        extraConfig:
          myConfig.py: |
            c.MyAuthenticator.host = get_config("custom.myHost")
      ```
