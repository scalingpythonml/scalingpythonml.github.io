The JupyterHub Architecture
===========================

The JupyterHub Helm Chart manages resources in the cloud using Kubernetes.
There are several moving pieces that, together, handle authenticating users,
pulling a Docker image specified by the administrator, generating the user
pods in which users will work, and connecting users with those pods.

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of the many pieces of
JupyterHub, and how they fit together in this process:
