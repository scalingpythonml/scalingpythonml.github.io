.. _user-environment:

Customizing User Environment
----------------------------

This page contains instructions for common ways to enhance the user experience.
For a list of all the configurable Helm chart options, see the
:ref:`helm-chart-configuration-reference`.

The *user environment* is the set of software packages, environment variables,
and various files that are present when the user logs into JupyterHub. The user
may also see different tools that provide interfaces to perform specialized
tasks, such as JupyterLab, RStudio, RISE and others.

A :term:`Docker image` built from a :term:`Dockerfile` will lay the foundation for
the environment that you will provide for the users. The image will for example
determine what Linux software (curl, vim ...), programming languages (Julia,
Python, R, ...) and development environments (JupyterLab, RStudio, ...) are made
available for use.

To get started customizing the user environment, see the topics below.



.. _existing-docker-image:

Choose and use an existing Docker image
***************************************

Project Jupyter maintains the `jupyter/docker-stacks repository
<https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/>`_, which contains ready to use
Docker images. Each image includes a set of commonly used science and data
science libraries and tools. They also provide excellent documentation on `how
to choose a suitable image
<https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html>`_.


If you wish to use another image from jupyter/docker-stacks than the
`base-notebook
<https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-base-notebook>`_
used by default, such as the `datascience-notebook
<https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook>`_
image containing useful tools and libraries for datascience, complete these steps:

#. Modify your ``config.yaml`` file to specify the image. For example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      singleuser:
        image:
          # Get the latest image tag at:
          # https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/tags/
          # Inspect the Dockerfile at:
          # https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/datascience-notebook/Dockerfile
          name: jupyter/datascience-notebook
          tag: 177037d09156

   .. note::

      Container image names cannot be longer than 63 characters.

      Always use an explicit ``tag``, such as a specific commit. Avoid using
      ``latest`` as it might cause a several minute delay, confusion, or
      failures for users when a new version of the image is released.

#. Apply the changes by following the directions listed in
   :ref:`apply the changes <apply-config-changes>`.


   .. note::

      If you have configured *prePuller.hook.enabled*, all the nodes in your
      cluster will pull the image before the hub is upgraded to let users
      use the image. The image pulling may take several minutes to complete,
      depending on the size of the image.

#. Restart your server from JupyterHub control panel if you are already logged in.

.. note::

   If you'd like users to select an environment from **multiple docker images**,
   see :ref:`multiple-profiles`.


.. _jupyterlab-by-default:

Use JupyterLab by default
*************************

`JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ is a new
user interface for Jupyter about to replace the classic user interface (UI).
While users already can interchange ``/tree`` and ``/lab`` in the URL to switch between
the classic UI and JupyterLab, they will default to use the classic UI.

The classic Jupyter Notebook UI is the default provided, but you can change it to
JupyterLab with the following config in your :term:`config.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
     defaultUrl: "/lab"

.. note::

   You need the ``jupyterlab`` package (installable via ``pip`` or ``conda``)
   for this to work. All images in the `jupyter/docker-stacks repository
   <https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/>`_ come pre-installed with it.


.. _custom-docker-image:

Customize an existing Docker image
**********************************

If you are missing something in the image that you would like all users to have,
we recommend that you build a new image on top of an existing Docker image from
jupyter/docker-stacks.

Below is an example :term:`Dockerfile` building on top of the *minimal-notebook*
image. This file can be built to a :term:`Docker image`, and pushed to a
:term:`image registry`, and finally configured in :term:`config.yaml` to be used
by the Helm chart.

.. code-block:: Dockerfile

   FROM jupyter/minimal-notebook:177037d09156
   # Get the latest image tag at:
   # https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/minimal-notebook/tags/
   # Inspect the Dockerfile at:
   # https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/minimal-notebook/Dockerfile

   # install additional package...
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir astropy

.. note:

   If you are using a private image registry, you may need to setup the image
   credentials. See the :ref:`helm-chart-configuration-reference` for more
   details on this.

.. _set-env-vars:

Set environment variables
*************************

One way to affect your user's environment is by setting :term:`environment
variables`. While you can set them up in your Docker image if you build it
yourself, it is often easier to configure your Helm chart through values
provided in your :term:`config.yaml`.

To set this up, edit your :term:`config.yaml` and
:ref:`apply the changes <apply-config-changes>`.
For example, this code snippet will set the environment variable ``EDITOR`` to the
value ``vim``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
     extraEnv:
       EDITOR: "vim"

You can set any number of static environment variables in the
:term:`config.yaml` file.

Users can read the environment variables in their code in various ways. In
Python, for example, the following code reads an environment variable's value:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   my_value = os.environ["MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE"]



.. _add-files-to-home:

About user storage and adding files to it
*****************************************

It is important to understand the basics of how user storage is set up. By
default, each user will get 10GB of space on a harddrive that will persist in
between restarts of their server. This harddrive will be mounted to their home
directory. In practice this means that everything a user writes to the home
directory (`/home/jovyan`) will remain, and everything else will be reset in
between server restarts.

A server can be shut down by *culling*. By default, JupyterHub's culling service
is configured to cull a users server that has been inactive for one hour. Note
that JupyterLab will autosave files, and as long as the file was within the
users home directory no work is lost.

.. note::

   In Kubernetes, a *PersistantVolume* (PV) represents the harddrive.
   KubeSpawner will create a PersistantVolumeClaim that requests a PV from the
   cloud. By default, deleting the PVC will cause the cloud to delete the PV.

Docker image's $HOME directory will be hidden from the user. To make these
contents visible to the user, you must pre-populate the user's filesystem. To do
so, you would include commands in the ``config.yaml`` that would be run each
time a user starts their server. The following pattern can be used in
:term:`config.yaml`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
     lifecycleHooks:
       postStart:
         exec:
           command: ["cp", "-a", "src", "target"]

Each element of the command needs to be a separate item in the list. Note that
this command will be run from the ``$HOME`` location of the user's running
container, meaning that commands that place files relative to ``./`` will result
in users seeing those files in their home directory. You can use commands like
``wget`` to place files where you like.

A simple way to populate the notebook user's home directory is to add the
required files to the container's `/tmp` directory and then copy them to
`/home/jovyan` using a ``postStart`` hook. This example shows the use of
multiple commands.

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
    lifecycleHooks:
        postStart:
          exec:
            command:
              - "sh"
              - "-c"
              - >
                cp -r /tmp/foo /home/jovyan;
                cp -r /tmp/bar /home/jovyan

Keep in mind that commands will be run **each time** a user starts
their server. For this reason, we recommend using ``nbgitpuller`` to synchronize
your user folders with a git repository.



.. _use-nbgitpuller:

Using ``nbgitpuller`` to synchronize a folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using the tool `nbgitpuller
<https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller>`_ to synchronize a folder
in your user's filesystem with a ``git`` repository whenever a user
starts their server.  This synchronization can also be triggered by
letting a user visit a link like
``https://your-domain.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/data-8/materials-fa18``
(e.g., as alternative start url).

To use ``nbgitpuller``, first make sure that you `install it in your Docker
image <https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller#installation>`_. Once this is done,
you'll have access to the ``nbgitpuller`` CLI from within JupyterHub. You can
run it with a ``postStart`` hook with the following configuration

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
     lifecycleHooks:
       postStart:
         exec:
           command: ["gitpuller", "https://github.com/data-8/materials-fa17", "master", "materials-fa"]

This will synchronize the master branch of the repository to a folder called
``$HOME/materials-fa`` each time a user logs in. See `the nbgitpuller
documentation <https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller>`_ for more information on
using this tool.

.. warning::

   ``nbgitpuller`` will attempt to automatically resolve merge conflicts if your
   user's repository has changed since the last sync. You should familiarize
   yourself with the `nbgitpuller merging behavior
   <https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller#merging-behavior>`_ prior to using the
   tool in production.


.. _setup-conda-envs:

Allow users to create their own ``conda`` environments for notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you want users to be able to create their own ``conda`` environments.
By default, any environments created in a JupyterHub session will not persist
across sessions. To resolve this, take the following steps:

1. Ensure the ``nb_conda_kernels`` package is installed in the root
   environment (e.g., see :ref:`r2d-custom-image`)

2. Configure Anaconda to install user environments to a folder within ``$HOME``.

   Create a file called ``.condarc`` in the home folder for all users, and make
   sure that the following lines are inside:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      envs_dirs:
        - /home/jovyan/my-conda-envs/

  The text above will cause Anaconda to install new environments to this folder,
  which will persist across sessions.

These environments are supposed to be used in notebooks, so a typical use case:

1. Create one with at least a kernel, e.g. for Python it's ``conda create -n myenv ipykernel scipy``

2. Now this env should be available in the list of kernels


.. _multiple-profiles:

Using multiple profiles to let users select their environment
*************************************************************

You can create configurations for multiple user environments,
and let users select from them once they log in to your JupyterHub. This
is done by creating multiple **profiles**, each of which is attached to a set
of configuration options that override your JupyterHub's default configuration
(specified in your Helm Chart). This can be used to let users choose among many
Docker images, to select the hardware on which they want their jobs to run,
or to configure default interfaces such as Jupyter Lab vs. RStudio.

Each configuration is a set of options for `Kubespawner <https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner>`_,
which defines how Kubernetes should launch a new user server pod. Any
configuration options passed to the `profileList` configuration will
overwrite the defaults in Kubespawner (or any configuration you've
added elsewhere in your helm chart).

Profiles are stored under ``singleuser.profileList``, and are defined as
a list of profiles with specific configuration options each. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
     profileList:
       - display_name: "Name to be displayed to users"
         description: "Longer description for users."
         # Configuration unique to this profile
         kubespawner_override:
           your_config: "Your value"
         # Defines the default profile - only use for one profile
         default: true

The above configuration will show a screen with information about this profile
displayed when users start a new server.

Here's an example with four profiles that lets users select the environment they
wish to use.

.. code-block:: yaml

   singleuser:
     # Defines the default image
     image:
       name: jupyter/minimal-notebook
       tag: 2343e33dec46
     profileList:
       - display_name: "Minimal environment"
         description: "To avoid too much bells and whistles: Python."
         default: true
       - display_name: "Datascience environment"
         description: "If you want the additional bells and whistles: Python, R, and Julia."
         kubespawner_override:
           image: jupyter/datascience-notebook:2343e33dec46
       - display_name: "Spark environment"
         description: "The Jupyter Stacks spark image!"
         kubespawner_override:
           image: jupyter/all-spark-notebook:2343e33dec46
       - display_name: "Learning Data Science"
         description: "Datascience Environment with Sample Notebooks"
         kubespawner_override:
           image: jupyter/datascience-notebook:2343e33dec46
           lifecycle_hooks:
             postStart:
               exec:
                 command:
                   - "sh"
                   - "-c"
                   - >
                     gitpuller https://github.com/data-8/materials-fa17 master materials-fa;

This allows users to select from three profiles, each with their own
environment (defined by each Docker image in the configuration above).

The "Learning Data Science" environment in the above example overrides the postStart lifecycle hook. Note that when
using ``kubespawner_override`` the values must be in the format that comply with the `KubeSpawner configuration
<https://jupyterhub-kubespawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spawner.html>`_.
For instance, when overriding the lifecycle
hooks in ``kubespawner_override``, the configuration is for ``lifecycle_hooks`` (snake_case) rather than ``lifecycleHooks`` (camelCase) which is
how it is used directly under the ``singleuser`` configuration section.
`A further explanation for this can be found in this github issue. <https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/issues/1242#issuecomment-484895216>`_

.. note::

   You can also **control the HTML used for the profile selection page** by
   using the Kubespawner ``profile_form_template`` configuration. See the
   `Kubespawner configuration reference <https://jupyterhub-kubespawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spawner.html>`_
   for more information.
