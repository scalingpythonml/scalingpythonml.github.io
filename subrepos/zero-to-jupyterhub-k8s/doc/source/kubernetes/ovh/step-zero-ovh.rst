Kubernetes on `OVHcloud <https://ovh.com/>`_ (OVH)
--------------------------------------------------

`OVHcloud <https://ovh.com/>`_ is a leader in the hosted private cloud services space in Europe.

They offer a managed Kubernetes service as well as a managed private registry for Docker images.

This page describes how to create a Kubernetes cluster using the OVH Control Panel,
and how to access the cluster using the command line with ``kubectl``.

1. Log in to the `OVH Control Panel <https://www.ovh.com/auth/>`_.

   .. note::

      You first need to create an OVH account if you don't have one already.

2. Click on the **Public Cloud** tab in the navigation bar.

3. If you don't have an OVH Stack, you can create one by clicking on the following button:

4. Select a name for the project

5. If you don't have a payment method yet, select one and click on "Create my project":

6. Using the **Public Cloud interface**, click on **Managed Kubernetes Service** and
   then **Create a Kubernetes cluster**:

7. Select a **Location**, **1.15** as the Kubernetes version and a **name** for the cluster:

8. Click on **Send**

9. Once the cluster is ready, click on **Nodes** to add 2 nodes:

      :alt: Add nodes to the cluster

   .. note::

      You can start with the **b2-7** flavor, or choosing a different flavor based
      on your requirements.

10. Download the ``kubeconfig`` file and store it under ``~/.kube/config`` on your machine.

   .. image:: ../../_static/images/ovh/kubeconfig.png
      :alt: Download the kubeconfig

11. To test if your cluster is initialized, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kubectl get node

   The response should list two running nodes (or however many nodes you
   set with ``--num-nodes`` above).

   .. note::

      Check out the `Kubernetes Documentation <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl>`_
      to install ``kubectl``.

Congrats! Now that you have your Kubernetes cluster running, it's time to
begin :ref:`creating-your-jupyterhub`.
