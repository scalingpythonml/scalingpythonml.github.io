Glossary
========

A partial glossary of terms used in this guide. For more complete descriptions
of the components in JupyterHub, see :ref:`tools`. Here we try to keep the
definition as succinct and relevant as possible, and provide links to learn more
details.

.. Additions to the glossary are welcomed. Please add in alphabetical order.

.. glossary::

   `admin user <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/authenticators-users-basics.html?highlight=admin>`_
      A user who can access the JupyterHub admin panel. They can start/stop user
      pods, and potentially access their notebooks.

   `authenticator <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/authenticators.html>`_
      The way in which users are authenticated to log into JupyterHub. There
      are many authenticators available, like GitHub, Google, MediaWiki,
      Dummy (anyone can log in), etc.
   
   `config.yaml`
      The :term:`Helm charts <Helm chart>` templates are rendered with these
      :term:`Helm values` as input. The file is written in the `YAML
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format. The YAML format is essential
      to grasp if working with Kubernetes and Helm.

   container
      A container is a isolated working space which for us gives users the
      tools, libraries, and capabilities to be productive.

   culler
      A separate process in the JupyterHub that stops the user pods of users who
      have not been active in a configured interval.

   Dockerfile
      A Dockerfile declares how to build a :term:`Docker image`.

   Docker image
      A Docker image, built from a :term:`Dockerfile`, allows tools like
      ``docker`` to create any number of :term:`containers <container>`.

   image registry
      A service for storing Docker images so that they can be stored
      and used later.
      The default public registry is at https://hub.docker.com,
      but you can also run your own private image registry.
      Many cloud providers offer private image registry services.

   `environment variables <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable>`_
      A set of named values that can affect the way running processes will
      behave on a computer. Some common examples are ``PATH``, ``HOME``, and
      ``EDITOR``.

   `Helm chart <https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/>`_
      A Helm chart is a group of :term:`Helm templates <Helm template>` that
      can, given its default values and overrides in provided ``yaml`` files,
      render to a set of :term:`Kubernetes resources <Kubernetes resource>` that
      can be easily installed to your Kubernetes cluster. In other words a Helm
      chart is like a configurable installation of software and infrastructure
      to exist on a cloud.

   `Helm template <https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/>`_
      A Helm template (``.yaml`` files), can given values, render to a
      :term:`Kubernetes resource`.

   `Helm values <https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/>`_
      :term:`Helm charts <Helm chart>` has a set of predefined values
      (`values.yaml`) typically overridden by other values in `config.yaml`. The
      final values are used to generate :term:`Kubernetes resources <Kubernetes
      resource>` from :term:`Helm templates <Helm template>` within a
      :term:`Helm chart`.

   Kubernetes
      For our purposes, you can think of Kubernetes as a way to speak to a cloud
      and describe what you would like it to do, in a manner that isn't specific
      for that cloud.

   Kubernetes API server
      The `Kubernetes API
      <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/>`_ server,
      also referred to as the master, will answer questions and update the
      desired state of the cluster for you. When you use ``kubectl`` you
      communicate with the API server.

   Kubernetes Pod
      *Pods* are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created
      and managed in Kubernetes. A pod will use a :term:`Docker image` to create
      a container, and most often a controller such as a Deployment will ensure
      there is always X running pods of a kind.

      See the `Kubernetes documentation
      <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/>`__ for more
      information.
   
   Kubernetes resource
      A Kubernetes resource can for example be a `Deployment
      <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/>`_,
      `Service
      <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/>`_ or a
      `Secret <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_. It
      is something you can request by the :term:`Kubernetes API server` to be
      present in the cluster.

   persistent storage
      A filesystem attached to a user pod that allows the user to store
      notebooks and files that persist across multiple logins.

   Node Pool
      A *node pool* or *node group* represents a set of nodes of the same kind.
      With cluster autoscaling, a node pool can grow and shrink based on demand
      allowing you to save computational resources.

   `repo2docker <https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker>`_
      A tool which lets you quickly convert a Git repository into a
      :term:`Docker image`.

   `spawner <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/spawners-basics.html>`_
      A spawner is a separate process created for each active user by
      JupyterHub. They are each responsible for one user. This Helm chart relies
      on `KubeSpawner
      <https://jupyterhub-kubespawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_.
