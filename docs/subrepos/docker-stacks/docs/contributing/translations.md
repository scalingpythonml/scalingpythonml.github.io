# Doc Translations

We are delighted when members of the Jupyter community want to help translate these documentation pages to other languages. If you're interested, please visit links below below to join our team on [Transifex](https://transifex.com) and to start creating, reviewing, and updating translations of the Jupyter Docker Stacks documentation.

1. Follow the steps documented on the [Getting Started as a Translator](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started-1/translators) page.
2. Look for *jupyter-docker-stacks* when prompted to choose a translation team. Alternatively, visit https://www.transifex.com/project-jupyter/jupyter-docker-stacks-1 after creating your account and request to join the project.
3. See [Translating with the Web Editor](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor) in the Transifex documentation.
